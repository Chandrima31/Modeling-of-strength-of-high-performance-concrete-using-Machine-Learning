# Problem statement
Modeling of strength of high performance concrete using Machine Learning.

# Dataset Description
The actual concrete compressive strength (MPa) for a given mixture under a specific age (days) was determined from laboratory. 
Data is in raw form (not scaled).The data has 8 quantitative input variables, and 1 quantitative output variable, and 
1030 instances (observations).
